				<div align="left">
				<p> Exquisite is an emergent, adaptive, and personalized lexicon builder. It employs clever functions to quickly add unknown words and concepts to an individualized studylist that then utilizes cognitive science principles to adaptively and automatically quiz and teach said concepts. Concepts can be flexibly adpated to suit the needs of the learner. This was conceptualized in UCSD's COGS187a class. In this class, we were given 5 weeks to work (sprint!) through the design process. </p>

				<h4> WEEK 1: TEAM LOGO DESIGN</h4>
				
			<br>
				<div align="left">
				<p> For our first assignment, we generated a name and logo for our team and settled on a random word: exquisite. We were also told to brainstorm potential ideas for a website or application to design and build throughout the duration of the class.
                    <br>
                    <h4>Problem</h4>
					I had found myself reading through an article or academic paper and needing a definition for a word. I'd look it up and move on with my reading. A week later, I saw the same word again, but forgot what it means. Even though I researched the term the week prior, I forgot what it meant. Frustrating! 
                </div>
                <img src="exquisite/exquisite.jpg" class="img-fluid d-block">
                    <br><br>
                <div align="left"><p>
                    With this app idea in mind, we set upon creating our team logo. I decided to mimic a dictionary's format in my logo proposal, hence the middots separating the syllables in "exquisite". We like the cleanliness that the logo had, and settled on it for our team logo. </p>
                </div>
			<br>
				<h4> WEEK 2: NEEDFINDING</h4>
				<div align="left">
				
					<p>With the general premise of our idea in place, we spent week 2 needfinding. The first part of the week was spent interviewing. We asked a variety of demographics a loose set of questions, and emerged with a few consistent themes. The first 
						was that people who don't read, don't care. The people who seemed interested in the idea were people who make continuous efforts to better themselves. 
						<br><br>
                        	
                        <img class="d-block img-fluid" src="exquisite/pic1.jpg">
                  
						<br><br>
						Through interviews and personal experience, I've noticed that <b>many people
                        have this arbitrary division in their knowledge.</b> They silo academic learning from everyday learning, book smarts from street smarts. This distinction is unfortunate, and the reason why people don't bother to actually learn a definition to
						a word rather than just reference Google. For many, the only learning that seems to matter is the learning that impacts their GPA. We want our app to bridge this learning dichotomy. The Exquisite app should broaden the user's lexicon. We want to help users integrate words and concepts they encounter each day into their broader body of knowledge wherein these concepts impacts the learning they care about.  </p>

				<h4> WEEK 4: INITIAL DESIGNS, USER FEEDBACK AND DESIGN DECISIONS</h4>
				
				<p> Week 4 saw a lot of changes! We started with my initial home screen design and iterated from there.</p>
				<br>
                <div class = "row" align="left">
                <div class = "col-sm-3">
				<img src="exquisite/lowfityler.jpg" class = "img-fluid">
                </div>
				<div class = "col-sm-9" >
                    <div class = "container" style="word-break: break-all;">
					<p>The top rectangle is a search bar. At this point, we knew what the search bar functions were: to find a word in your list, a word in our dictionary that you may want to add, or search for a public list.
						<br><br>
                        "Biology" and "CogSci" were called 'sublists' which eventually became <i>stacks.</i> These were a way to organize all of the words that a user had added.
						Below that was "MyList", which had about 5 different names throughout the process. That is the large list of all words you have added. Every word you add exists in that list. You can tap on a word and it displays the definition.
						<br><br>
						At the bottom is a 'Study' button. That was emphasized because our goal is to teach the terms to the user. Ultimately, through user testing and intuition, we found it to disrupt the overall design of
						what we had going. One user said it stuck out like a sore thumb. We decided to move past this idea.
						<br><br>
						The next iteration is our Low-Fi digital prototype, downloadable <a href="assets/Balasmiq Prototype.pdf" download>here (Interactive PDF).</a>
						<br><br>
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class = row>
                    <div class = "col-sm-3">
                        <br><br>
                        <img src="exquisite/Screen Shot 2016-08-31 at 8.48.23 PM.png" class = "img-fluid">
                        </div>
                    
                    <div class = "col-sm-9">
    
                        <p>
                        <br><br>
						This is the next home screen iteration. (from the low-fi digital prototype)
						<br><br>
						
						Here, we introduce a few features. The + at the top left is used to add a new word or new list. "Recently Added" shows your most recently added words, with a few of them previewed. We found this necessary because adding a word from
						the iOS context menu requires you to share to the app, meaning that we can't sort the word into a list without opening the exquisite app. We felt that took too long, so recently added is where the user is directed to sort terms.
						<br><br>
						Big List is the same as MyList, just given a new name.
						<br><br>
						At the bottom, we have what were called buttons, menu, and finally tabs. The icon lit in red is where the user is at any one point. Home takes user  home. Pencil is for studying (not writing - we changed that). The gears are for settings.
						<br><br>
						In hindsight, we should have formally defined and written down what we called every single feature -- from 'tabs' to 'sublists' to 'stacks' and on. We had several occasions where we passionately disagreed with 
						each other, only to find out that we were using different terminology for the same idea and actually agreed with each other.
						</p>

				<h4> WEEK 5: ITERATION TO FINAL CLASS PROTOTYPE</h4>
				<br>
				<a href="http://adobe.ly/2bMRhPn">Final Demo (linear)</a>
				<br>
				<br>
				<div align="left">
				<p> In week 5, we implemented our Flexible Flashcards. Each term has 2 default flashcards. One is the term, the other is the definition. From there, the user can add as many flashcards to their 'stack'of flashcards for that term. Users can add various photos and video to each card. In addition, every single card can be drawn on using the touch screen.
					The home screen is in 'dictionary' format, where if the user taps a word, they see the definition, but no more. 
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<img src="exquisite/flashcard drawing.png" class = "img-fluid d-block">
				<br><br>
                <div align="left">
					Around this time, we had a clever technological realization that made our implementation significantly easier. To enable platform agnosticism (ability to add words and view words from iPhone, Chrome extension, Android, etc.) we decided to base all flashcards on a CSV file format. If the user decides to connect to a Dropbox or Google Drive account, they can host their own directory of terms so they can add to access them from exquisite on any device. 
					This also made importing and exporting cards and terms significantly easier. It also saves us the overhead of server costs and account systems to save each user's personalized terms and lists.
					<br><br>
					Back to the design!
<br><br>
				</div>
                <div class = "row">
                    <div class = "col-sm-3">
                        <img src="exquisite/finalhome.png" class="img-fluid"> <br><br>
                        
                    </div>
                    <div class = "col-sm-9">
                        <div align="left">
					You'll notice that we got rid of the instagram-style tabs on the bottom of the home screen (though I truncated the screenshot). I am particuarly proud of how we managed to maintain critical functions while tucking away. We were very careful about where and how we tucked them away, though. You won't find yourself tapping more than 3 times to access any function on the homescreen.
				        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
				
                <div class = "row">
                    <div class = "col-sm-3">
                        <img src="exquisite/ellipse.png" class = "img-fluid">
                    </div>
                    <div class = "col-sm-9">
                        <div align="left">
					This approach had us step back and consider what was most important: the words. They're yours, and we want you to learn them. We embedded study, edit, notifications, and related functions in the three vertical dots to the right side of each list head. We didn't like the idea of a study or notifications hub. The only way we saw that working was with a littany of dropdown menus, which we think are a pain in the ass.
					So, you tap the elipses just right of the list you want to study, to edit, or to notify you. We thought this made the most sense, and it allowed us to get rid of the study button and edit buttons. We also got rid of the home button, just tap the exquisite logo to go back to the home page.
