                        Not all design projects need a new UI. Philanthrobot is a project that I led for UCSD’s COGS160 Social Computing class. Inspired by the backlash regarding President Trump's 2017 immigration ban, philanthropists matched donations to the ACLU. Twitter users @replied their ACLU donation receipts for validation.
                    </p>
              
                    <p>
                      Chris Sacca ultimately matched $150,000 in ACLU donations on Twitter. There are passionate people on Twitter who are generous enough to donate <i>if they care about an issue and the donation is matched.</i> 
                    </p>

                        <h5><b>The Online Donation Matching Space</b></h5>
                        <p>
                            Donation matching functions to encourage more donations from donors. The matching party offers a sum of money wherein every donation made within a timeframe is matched up until the sum runs out. It offers an incentive for potential donors to double the impact of their donation. 
                            
                            Corporate donation matching and In-kind donation matching are well-worn spaces, but we want to faciliate donations among individuals and work on a grassroots level. That's why  Philanthrobot only needs is a topic and a link to point users to...but more on that later. First, we explored the problem space.<br /><br>
                            
                            <h5><b>Problems in Donation Matching</b></h5>
                        <ul>
                        <li><p>Lack of discoverability. People donate, but miss out on donation-matched money. Many people don't know that donations are matched on an individual level.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Lack of knowledge. Many people simply aren't aware that this is an option they can choose.</p></li>
                        <li><p>People want to donate, but where is best? How can the donation be maximized? Interviewees told stories of not trusting various nonprofits, citing how donating to certain organizations doesn't impact the issue as much as funding the organization.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Limiting Timeframes. Donation matching offers are usually only valid for a brief period of time. By the time a user discovers an opportunity, it may have expired.</p></li><br />
                            
                        </ul>
                        <h5><b>Existing Solutions</b></h5>
                        <p>Directories of donation matching opportunities were built at the time of the travel ban to solve the discoverability problem. But these directories aren't discoverable in and of themselves. They rely on search engine optimization and our interviewees don't Google "donation matching for ..." before donating. They don't know they can, they forget, they think too much work, or the matching opportunity expired.</p>
                        
                            
                    <h4>Why leverage Twitter?</h4>
                        <p>Twitter is the place where activists, philanthropists, passionate and ordinary people coexist. We know potential donors are there, and Philanthrobot can find them! Who are they? </p>
                    <br />
                            
                        <ul><b><p>Twitter Users</p></b>
                            <li><p>Passionate, political, activist users</p></li>
                            <li><p>Think: they can make a difference in the world</p></li>
                            <li><p>Feel: passionately about issues, wants change</p></li>
                            <li><p>Do: engage in emotional Twitter conversations about issues, will donate to a matching opportunity</p></li>
                        </ul>   
                            
                    <h5>The User Flow</h5> 
                        <p>The Twitter user browses their Twitter feed normally. They receive a tweet from @Philanthrobot that introduces a donation matching opportunity for an issue that the Twitter use is engaged in on Twitter. If interested, the Twitter user clicks the link to the opportunity and donates if desired.</p>     
                           
                    <h5>Philanthrobot's Flow</h5>
                        <p>The Philanthrobot starts with a topic area and a link to a donation matching opportunity. From there, a targeting algorithm parses through user profile data extracted from the Twitter API. Philanthrobot then crafts a Tweet containing an analytic link to the matching opportunity and sends it to each targeted user. </p>
            <br />

          <h4>Research and Concept Validation</h4>
          <p>The Chris Sacca tweet above demonstrates that passionate people will donate via Twitter to causes they care about. But Philanthrobot is a different proposition. We needed to test whether or not this could actually work.</p><br />
          
          <h5>What we (think we) know:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://www.classy.org/blog/tapping-into-social-proof-to-gain-new-donors-2/">Social proof matters. More social proof makes the Twitterbot more trustworthy, yielding more donations.</a></p></li> 
            <li><p><a href= "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00086">Twitter bots have a reputation of being shady, spammy, and annoying. Tweets should be highly targeted to avoid annoyance and improve effectiveness. Social proof also helps counteract the stigma of a Twitter bot.</a></p></li>
            <li><p>Matching opportunities must be timely, especially on Twitter. The issue needs to be charged, relevant, and put right in front of users. News and outrage moves on fast. Outrage prompts donations.</p></li>
            <li><p>Success of Philanthrobot will depend on the issues that currently have matching oportunities. More passionate issues elicit more donations.</p></li>
          </ul> 

        <br /><br>   
                <h5>Research Questions</h5>
                    <ul>
                    <li><p>What concerns do users have when contacted by a bot? How do they react?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How do users react when approached with a donation matching opportunity?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What type of bot profile looks most legitimate and least spammy? How do users react to different types of profiles?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Which users are most likely to donate?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What tweet wording is most effective?</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>Does this concept have promise?</b></p></li>
                    </ul>
        <br /><br>
          
          
                        <h5> Research Methodology</h5><br />
                            <p>User interviews, user surveys, a target demographic profile compilation analysis and <a href="http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/chi15.airport.grevet.pdf" target="_blank">piggyback prototyping</a> to generate data that informed design decisions. </p>
        
                    <h5>Interview Findings (prelilminary research findings?)</h5>
                        <ul>
                        <li><p>Users are concerned about the legitimacy of a donation opportunity and Twitter Account, the safety of the link, and the annoyance of potential spam.</p>
                            <ul><li><p>Design Takewaway: Twitter profile social proof is critical. Legitimate-looking profiles have many followers, are verified, are currently active, and have been active for a while (month+).</p></li></ul></li>
                        <li><p>Users are more receptive to donation matching opportunities if the opportunity is highly relevant to their interests and if they are aware of the organization they are donating to and/or the donation matcher
                            <ul><li><p>Design Takeaway: accurate user targeting is critical. </p></li></ul></li>
                        <li><p>Tweet Wording: surveys indicate that pathos tweets were more preferred by users than generic or sales-y worded tweets.</p>
                             <ul><li><p>Design Takeaway: Tweet with pathos and avoid any wording that may generate feelings of privacy violation. </p></li></ul></li>
                            </ul>     <br /><br>
                        
                    <h4>Targeting Twitter Profiles: Building a Model using Demographic Analysis </h4><br />
                    <p>I performed an analysis of 13 Twitter users who have donated to organizations in the recent past. Sourced through this (since deleted) tweet:</p><br />
                            
                    <center><figure class="figure">
                    <img src = "img/philanthrobot/anilDash.png" class = "img-fluid figure-img rounded" style="max-width: 80%">
                    <figcaption class="figure-caption"><p>Each applicable response (N=13) to the above tweet was recorded for several relevant variables that are accessible via the Twitter API.</p></figcaption>
                    </figure></center>
                    <br /><br>
                    <p>All Profile data was compiled and profile commonalities were synthesized. Commonalities are used to target profiles likely to donate. (separate/independent from topic of donation matching opportunity)</p><br />
                    <h5>Confirmed Donor Twitter Profile Commonalities </h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Name: Real name used.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Occupation communicated, usually @listed in description</p></li>
                        <li><p>Description written with mature language (not explicit), often includes: "views here do not represent those of my employer"</p></li>
                        <li><p>Profile picture is usually of user</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tweet Topics: generally about politics and current events</p></li>
                        <li><p>Location: almost always listed</p></li>
                        <li><p>Website: very often listed</p></li>
                        <li><p>Age: 25+</p></li>
                        <li><p>Additionally, users are active on Twitter.</p></li>
                    </ul><br />
                    <h5>Data Limitations</h5>
                    <p>Largely South Asian, Political Interests. Findings may lack external validity. Small Sample size of N=13. Project was under a tight time crunch.</p> <br /><br>
                    
                    <h5>Prototyping Twitter Profile</h5>
                    <p>I appropriated my current Twitter account for this project because it was 8 years old with 46 followers. With name, profile pictures, and handle changed, it appeared more legitimate and had more social proof than a newly created profile. We used survey research to refine the Twitterbot profile. We optimized around trustworthiness and curiosity/intrigue. We want the user to trust the account, and be curious enough to investigate the opportunity sent to them.</p>
                    <br /><br>
          
                    <h5>Prototyping Tweet Wording</h5>
                    <p>At the time of this project, each tweet had a cap of 140 characters (currently 280). Consistent and effectively worded programmatic tweets were difficult with this constraint because Twitter handles have different length. This is no longer an issue. <br /><br>
                    We tested various forms of tweet wording through surveys.  Respondents frowned upon phrases like “Double your donation for a limited time!” because they feel sales-y and disingenuous. Appeals to pathos generated a more positive response. This is the style of tweet we employed. </p>
                    
                    <img src="img/philanthrobot/sampleTweet.png" class = "img-fluid">
                    
                     <h5>Concept Testing With Piggyback Prototyping</h5><br />
                            
                    <p>The donation matching opportunity that we prototyped was for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer foundation. While not the ideal issue nor organization for Philanthrobot, it was the only active opportunity in the narrow time frame allotted for this project. We strongly believe that data would be stronger given a more charged issue, more reputable organization, and a more easily active and targeted Twitter demographic. Alas, this is what we had to work with.</p><br /><br>
                    
                    <p>We searched for target demographics and manually inspected hundreds of Twitter profiles for this matching opportunity. We searched for older women because they are commonly targeted by nonprofits and are directly affected by Breast Cancer. However, they are not ideal Twitter donors because they are not a large nor engaged Twitter population. Each profile was graded on a standard grade scale according to the Confirmed Twitter Donor Commonality criteria described above (link). On the grade scale, A is predicted to be most likely to donate, F is least likely. There were no A grades given. A total of 42 accounts were given a ‘tweetable grade’ of B, C, or D. Here are the results.</p><br />

                    <p>Despite the small sample size (N = 42), we saw a promising tweet engagement rate of 21% and a link click rate of 7% in 24 hours. More promising is that B grades performed significantly better than C and D grades, suggesting that aspects of Twitter profiles are predictive of engagement and conversion. Furthermore, we didn't deem any profiles to be A grades due to time constraints. This Twitter bot is rate limited, so A grade targeting is the goal. While this isn’t necessarily a complete validation of the Philanthrobot concept, it shows promise considering the unfavorable and limiting matching opportunity of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. However, the testing window was only 24 hours and the target demographic of users were than 40 years old. Older users are less active. Nevertheless, extrapolating this severly unoptimized algorithm to N=10,000 at the link click rate of 7%, may yield around 700 curious potential donors that would not have considered donating otherwise. </p>
