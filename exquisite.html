<h1>Exquisite</h1><h6></h6>
<h6>Wield the power of cognitive science for seamless vocabulary learning.</h6>            
<b><p>Case Study: Human-Centered Design, iOS Development, Sketch</p></b>
<p>The original Exquisite project was for UCSD’s Usability and Information Architecture class. Originally created in a 5-week sprint with a multidisciplinary team, it has since been redesigned. In between work and classes, I taught myself iOS development to build this app and better understand mobile development. It's scheduled to release in the fall!</p>

 <h1>The First Prototype</h1><br />
            
    <h6>Problem it addressed:</h6> <p>Users define unknown words only to forget them afterwards.</p>
    <br />
    <h6>Our Angle:</h6> <p>What if when you defined a word, it was automatically added to a study list and it was intermittently quizzed until you learned it?</p>
    <br />
    <h6>Our implementation:</h6> <p>A mobile vocabulary app that uses contextual action to define and save words. Select an unknown word and 'share' it to Exquisite share/action extension wherein it is defined and added to a studylist. From there, the app  sends notifications to remind the user to study or recall the word definition.</p>
    <br />
            
<div class="row">
    <!--First Prototype (home screen)-->
    <div class="col-sm-4"><iframe width="438" height="930" src="//invis.io/QU8AW506P" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="transform: scale(0.6);"></iframe></div>
            
    <div class="col-sm-8"><h5>The First Prototype</h5><p> <i>Interact with it!</i><br /><br>
                
    This prototype features the home screen. It tests the core dictionary interaction. Tap a word to toggle its definition. Above "my list" are other vocabulary lists. Tap 'music' to toggle the music list. At the top you will see the most nebulous and unobvious search bar fathomable. At the bottom is a "study" button which originally brought the current list to flashcard form. It wasn't obvious where exactly which list was going to be 'studied'. </p></div>

<!--Final Class Prototype-->
<div class="row">

        <h5>Final Class Prototype</h5>
            <p>This prototype was built with Adobe XD, hence the different iframe embed border! This particular prototype is linear. It was designed for a final presenation walkthrough. To get started, click "Exquisite" and then "share". <br />
            </p>
            </div></div>
</div>
            
    <h6>Muddled Vision:</h6> 
            <p>
        Our original vision solved a simple problem that users validated. We considered adding flashcard functionality, but it was cursory to the core of the app. Our instructor, however, was enamored by the prospect of a system of flexible, shareable, annotated flashcards. The instructor was excited by our project, so we didn't second guess it. To users, Exquisite became a flashcard app -- a Quizlet with a function to contextually add words.  <br /><br>
        
        The instructor loved our final project -- so we did too. A year later, I decided to pursue development for learning purposes. I explained what the project was to friends and family, but I could never quite convey exactly what Exquisite was. But it hit me: Exquisite was basically Quizlet with one new feature. Yikes.<br /><br>
                
        I made a couple of mistakes. One, I put too much stock in one piece of feedback. But worse -- I built most of it before I noticed. It was an app for casual vocabulary learners, yet the most considered feedback was from my professor who wanted a new teaching tool. The professor envisioned Quizlet, but it already existed. And Exquisite didn't match up favorably. It became more obvious as I looked at the bland final class prototype. Exquisite needed to be redesigned.</p>
        

        
   
            
        
        <h2>The Redesign</h2>
               
 <p>First, I spoke to users. Then, I sat down to clarify the problem, the product, and its direction.</p>

            <h5>Old Problem: Users define unknown words only to forget them afterwards. </h5>
                
            <h5>New Problem: Users don't want to study to expand their vocabulary. </h5>
            <!-- the old contextual adding is still in effect, but it's a cursory piece. Not the core product. -->
            <!-- design informed by the market. TestPrep market is particularly underserved.-->
<br />
            
<h1>User insights</h1>
<h3>Who are the users?</h3>
<ul>
    <li><p>People who must communicate effectively. </p></li>
    <li><p>People who prioritize self-improvement.</p></li>
    <li><p>People who don't have time to dedicate to vocabulary.</p></li>
    <li><p>Students, Writers, Speakers, Designers, Businesspeople...</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Think:</b> they would like to expand vocabulary</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Feel:</b> like studying vocabulary is a low leverage activity. High effort for low reward.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Do:</b> not study vocabulary, but learn new words in daily life.</p></li>
</ul><br />
    <p>Insight: people don't study vocabulary, but still learn new words.</p>
        
                
<h4>Product's Value Proposition:</h4><h5> With Exquisite you can seamlessly curate and effortlessly learn vocabulary.</h5>
<br /> 

<h5>Translating Value Proposition into Design Goals</h5>
<p>I broke the value proposition into design goals go guide the redesign. Achieve these goals and the value proposition is fulfilled. The minimal viable product must achieve each.</p> 
<ol>
    <li> <p>Seamlessly Curate Words</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li> <p>Defining and saving words in (and outside of) the app is quick, simple, and easy to discover.</p></li>
        </ul>
        
    
    <li> <p>Effortlessly Learn Words</p></li>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Utilize cognitive science of learning and memory principles to maximize learning.</p></li>
            <li><p>Interface requires minimal cognitive overhead to process information and navigate. Cognitive Effort is focused on the words.</p></li>
            <li><p>Users don’t have to remember to study these words. They don’t need formal study sessions. Learning occurs in seamless and emergent intervals.</p></li>
        </ul>
    
    
</ol>

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            
            <h5>Behind it all.</h5>
            <p>The Mastery system. It underlies</p>
                <br />
            <h5>Goal 1: Effortlessly Learn Words</h5>
                <h6></h6>
                <h6>First Implementation: Context Keyboard</h6><p>We can learn without studying through <strong>context</strong>.
                The Context Keyboard leverages contextual learning. It analyzes the context of what you type and suggests a word that makes sense from your Exquisite list in the QuickType bar. Using a word in context is an effective way to learn it!</p>
                <br /><br>
<img src="http://placehold.it/650x250" alt="..." class="img-fluid">
                <br /><br>
                <p>Type as normal, when the keyboard recognizes a context in which one of your vocabulary words fits, it will suggest it to you in green with a subtle audible “pop”. Tap the word to see the definition and ensure the word makes sense in the context and for a brief ‘study moment’. If it does, tap it again to insert the word. Else, tap above the keyboard to dismiss.</p>
                <br /><br>
<img src="http://placehold.it/650x250" alt="..." class="img-fluid">
                <br /><br>
                <p>I found that most users use the standard iOS keyboard. Hence, the Context Keyboard is designed to look and feel like the standard Apple iOS keyboard, but with the functionality of contextual vocabulary learning augmenting the standard QuickType bar. Users lack patience with different keyboards. Therefore, it must work flawlessly. No slowdowns nor crashes, else the user will abandon it.</p>
            <br /><br>

                <p>But It’s unlikely that a user will learn all of their vocabulary words with the Context Keyboard. Exquisite tracks usage metrics for each word and feeds them through an algorithm to emphasize unused and unknown words in Microquiz Notifications. </p>
                <br />
                

                
        <h5>Second Implementation: Microquiz Notifications </h5>
            <p><b>Exquisite's notifications are microquizzes that you do on your time.</b></p>
               <p> No need to open the app. Microquizzes are completed in the notification center. But they don't interrupt you. No sound, no vibration. They are designed to be <i>not annoying</i>. Microquiz notifications are integral to the app, and are thoughtfully designed as such.</p>

        Each exquisite vocabulary word has a mastery rating. This is a metric of how well the user knows each word: Know, Kind of Know, Don't Know. These ratings can be changed by tapping the emoji. Exquisite's Mastery ratings, micro quiz scores, and context keyboard usage informs the user about what to focus on.
                
        
        <h5>Lists Reworked</h5>
        <p>
                Every list is different in terms of content and user goals. That’s why exquisite lists have settings! They're located in the new list dashboard.
                <br /><br>
                Proper list settings are critical to Exquisite's effectiveness. But I found that users didn't grasp which settings would yield desired results. As a result, you'll notice the "Learn List By:" setting. If the user is taking the GRE on June 1st, simply enter that date and exquisite will tailor a study plan of notifications towards meeting that goal! If no specific date is given, list settings can be dissociated. List settings control Notifications and basic study reminders. Every word shows up in the context keyboard.

                Navigating lists has changed too. Before, lists were toggled through search. That was clumsy and confusing. Now, tap the blue list title at the top. Select to view the list or study its flashcards. The list has a triangle dropdown indicator to signify the title's affordance of list changing.

                for old+new: A lot more went into these design decisions, I'd be happy to discuss further... email here:.
        </p>
        <h4> Visual Design</h4>
            <br />
               <p> The goal for the visual design is to focus on the words. The user's cognitive effort is to be focused on the words, not the interace. That being said, the interface isn't bland like a dictionary page. Each word is on a virtual flashcard for visual relief and to hint at powerful functions. You'll see bits of color to highlight some relevant items and interactions. No function is hidden behind a swipe or gesture without a visual button or hint to accompany it because usability is prioritized. Swipes and gestures are used as accelerators.</p>
                <br /> <br>  
        
        <h4>Monetization</h4>
        
        <h4> Flashcards </h4>
        <p>
       The goal of not needing to study to learn vocabulary was never feasible at scale. The more words, the more difficult it is. That's why there are flashcards. Those with more words to learn can study them with flashcards. Microquiz notifications and the context keyboard can then accelerate their learning. 
            
                
        But the goal was not in vain! In this case, undershooting an intentionally difficult goal improved the product more than meeting and easier goal. I would have never considered the context keyboard if I wasn't thinking in terms of teaching without studying.
