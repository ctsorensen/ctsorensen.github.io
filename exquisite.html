<p>Originally created in a 5-week sprint with a multidisciplinary team, this iOS app has since been redesigned. In between work and classes, I taught myself iOS development to build this app and better understand mobile development. It's scheduled to release in the fall!

 <h2>Original Vision</h2><br />
            
    <p><b>Problem:</b> <br />
        Users define unknown words only to forget them afterwards.</p>
    
            <p><b>Angle:</b><br />
                What if when you defined a word, it was automatically added to a study list and it was intermittently quizzed until you learned it?</p>
            
    <p><b>Implementation:</b> <br />A mobile vocabulary app that uses contextual action to define and save words. Select an unknown word and 'share' it to Exquisite share/action extension wherein it is defined and added to a studylist. From there, the app  sends notifications to remind the user to study or recall the word definition.</p>

    This prototype features the home screen. It tests the core dictionary interaction which largely remains. 
            <ul style="padding-left:0px">
           <li> Tap a word to toggle its definition. The part of speech, definition, and example sentence are displayed below. Tap again to dismiss. This core interaction remains in the latest prototype. </li>
            
           <li> Above "my list" are other vocabulary lists. Tap 'music' to toggle the music list. Words from the music list are displayed. Words from other lists are blurred. </li>
            
           <li> At the top you will see the most nebulous and unobvious search bar fathomable. Prototypes aren't always pretty!
            </li>
           <li> At the bottom is a "study" button which originally brought the current list to flashcard form. The study function was embedded into the lists themselves which freed up valuable screen space.</li>

                This prototype was built with Adobe XD, hence the different iframe embed border! This prototype is linear. To get started, click "Exquisite" and then "share". The beginning demonstrates contextual word defining. From there, you can see the actual app screens. </p>

                <li>This prototype features all lists on one page. This was changed for simplicity. Different Lists are now toggled through underlined title text at the top of the screen.
                </li>
                <li>The search bar in this prototype is always present in the list view, but was hidden in later versions. Now, swipe down on the word list to reveal the search bar.</li>
                <li>The three ellipse "more functions" button was introduced in this prototype. This is where edit and delete functions lie. In the latest prototype, they are also accessible by swiping left.</li>

    <h5>Muddled Vision</h5> 
            <p>
        Our original vision solved a simple problem that users validated. We considered adding flashcard functionality, but it was cursory to the core of the app. Our instructor, however, was enamored by the prospect of a system of flexible, shareable, annotated flashcards. The instructor was excited by our project, so we didn't second guess it. To users, Exquisite became a flashcard app with the ability to contextually save words.  <br /><br>
        
        The instructor loved our final project -- so we did too. A year later, I decided to pursue development for learning purposes. I explained what the project was to friends and family, but I could never quite convey exactly what Exquisite was or why it should exist. But it hit me: Exquisite was basically Quizlet with one new feature. Yikes.<br /><br>
                
        I made a couple of mistakes. One, I put too much stock in one piece of feedback. But worse -- I built most of it before I noticed. It was an app for casual vocabulary learners, yet the most considered feedback was from my professor who wanted a new teaching tool. The professor envisioned Quizlet, but it already existed. And Exquisite didn't match up favorably. It became more obvious as I looked at the bland final class prototype. Exquisite needed to be redesigned.<br></p>

                Users don't want to study to expand their vocabulary. </p>
            <!-- the old contextual adding is still in effect, but it's a cursory piece. Not the core product. -->
            <!-- design informed by the market. TestPrep market is particularly underserved.-->

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            
                <br />
            <h5>Goal 1: Effortlessly Learn Words</h5><br>
                <h6><b>First Implementation: Mastery System</b></h6><p>
                The mastery system is a reflection of how well the user knows their words. Each word has three ratings: don't know 👎 , somewhat know👌, and mastered 👍. Each list has a mastery % which is calculated by how well the user has mastered each word in the list. The Mastery system not only informs the user what they need to learn, but also informs the Exquisite app as to what it needs to teach the user.
    </p><br>
                <h6><b>Second Implementation: Context Keyboard</b></h6><p>
                We already learn vocabuary words without studying. How? Through context! The Context Keyboard uses the context of sentences that you type to teach your vocabulary words. It analyzes the context of what you type and suggests a word that makes sense from your Exquisite list in the QuickType bar. Using a word in context is an effective way to learn it!</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Type as normal, when the keyboard recognizes a context in which one of your vocabulary words fits, it will suggest it to you in green with a subtle audible “pop”.</li>
                        <li>Tap the word to see the definition (it scrolls) and ensure the word makes sense in the context and for a brief ‘study moment’.</li>
                        <li>If the word makes sense, tap it again to insert the word. Else, tap above the keyboard to dismiss.</li>
                    </ol>

                <br />
                <p>Most users use the standard iOS keyboard. Hence, the Context Keyboard is designed to look and feel like the standard Apple iOS keyboard, but with the functionality of contextual vocabulary learning augmenting the standard QuickType bar. User interviews indicated that users lack patience with different keyboards. Therefore, the keyboard must work flawlessly. No slowdowns nor crashes, else the user will abandon it.</p>
            <br />
                <p>But It’s unlikely that a user will learn all of their vocabulary words with the Context Keyboard. Exquisite tracks usage metrics for each word and feeds them to an algorithm that prioritizes unused and unknown words for Microquiz Notifications. </p>
                <br />
                

                
        <h6><b>Third Implementation: Microquiz Notifications </b></h6>
            <p><i>Exquisite's notifications are microquizzes that you do on your time.</i> No need to open the app. Microquizzes are completed in the notification center. But they don't interrupt you. No sound, no vibration. <i>They are designed to not be annoying</i>. Microquiz notifications are integral to the app, and are thoughtfully designed as such.</p>

        <h5>Lists Reworked</h5>
        <p>
                Every list is different in terms of content and user goals. That’s why exquisite lists have settings! They're located in the new list dashboard.
                <br /><br>
                Proper list settings are critical to Exquisite's effectiveness. But I found that users didn't grasp which settings would yield desired results. As a result, you'll notice the "Learn List By:" setting. If the user is taking the GRE on June 1st, simply enter that date and exquisite will tailor a study plan of notifications towards meeting that goal! If no specific date is given, list settings can be dissociated. List settings control Notifications and basic study reminders. Every word shows up in the context keyboard.

                Navigating lists has changed too. Before, lists were toggled through search. That was clumsy and confusing. Now, tap the blue list title at the top. Select to view the list or study its flashcards. The list has a triangle dropdown indicator to signify the title's affordance of list changing.
                <br><br>
               
        </p>
        
        <h4> Visual Design</h4>
            <br />
               <p> The goal for the visual design is to focus on the words. The user's cognitive effort is to be focused on the words, not the interace. That being said, the interface isn't as bland as a dictionary page. Each word is on a virtual flashcard for visual relief. You'll see bits of color to highlight some relevant items and interactions. AlsNo function is hidden behind a swipe or gesture without a visual button or hint to accompany it because usability is prioritized. Swipes and gestures are used as accelerators.</p>
                <br /> <br>  
        
        <h4> Flashcards </h4>
        <center><img src="img/exquisite/landscapeFlashcard.png" class="img-fluid" style="max-height:400px"></center>
        <p>
      The more words, the more difficult it is to learn them without studying. And for students who need to learn a large volume quickly, there are flashcards. They aren't annotations, but the mastery system is integrated during studying. The 'eye' icon toggles the viewing mode. Tap the 'eye' and the word is by itself. Tap the card and the definition is on the back. The 'shuffle' icon randomizes the order of the words.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Monetization</h4>
        <p>
        The app will be monetized through in-app purchases of curated word lists. For example, the GRE study list will include about 1000 curated and defined vocabulary words. Free curated lists will also be available.

        <h5>Some Learnings</h5>
        <ul style="padding-left:0px">
        <li><p>Engineering capabilities can constrain design direction. It's important to know the capabilities of the technologies utilized. It can dictate anything from major functions to minor styling.</p></li>
        <li><p>Intentionally lofty goals can lead to novel solutions. These are useful even if not entirely achieved. I accomplished more than I otherwise would have.</p></li>
        <li><p>Constantly question my assumptions and reasoning behind design decisions.</p></li>

        </ul>
