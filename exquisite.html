                <center><h3>Case Study</h3><h5>Project to Prototype to Product </h5></center> <br>
The original Exquisite project was for UCSD’s Usability and Information Architecture class. It was created in a 5-week sprint with a multidisciplinary team. You can read the tale of user-profiling, rapid-prototyping, interest-clashing, design-decisions, and brutal-deadlines.HERE, I CONSOLIDATE LEARNINGS FROM THIS GROUP AND MY OTHER DESIGN GROUPS... <strong>here.</strong> The old prototype is located <strong>here.</strong> It's come a looooong way. (images?) drawing->balsalmic->mockup->final
<br /><br>

<br /> <br>
 I taught myself iOS development to build this app, better understand mobile development, and have fun.
<br /> <br>
 But, as I referenced the prior class prototype during development, I noticed the class prototype was bland and lacking. I had new user insights and ideas. Time for a redesign! First, I spoke to more users. Then, I sat down to clarify the problem, the product, and its direction.
<br /><br>
                
                <h2> Problem</h2> 
                <h5>Old Problem: Users define unknown words only to forget them. </h5>
                USER INSIGHT
                <h5>New Problem: Users don't want to study to expand their vocabulary. </h5>
<br />
            
<h1>User insights</h1>
<ul><h3>Who are the users?</h3>
    <li>People who must communicate effectively. </li>
    <li>People who prioritize self-improvement.</li>
    <li>People who don't have time to dedicate to vocabulary.</li>
    <li>Students, Writers, Speakers, Designers, Businesspeople...</li>
</ul>
                <h3>Bios?</h3>
<br />
                
<h2> Value proposition:</h2><h3> With Exquisite you can seamlessly curate and effortlessly vocabulary.</h3>
<br />

<h2>Process</h2>  
            

I broke the value proposition into design goals go guide the redesign. Achieve these goals and the value proposition is fulfilled. The minimal viable product must achieves each.
<br> 
<br>
<ol>
    <li> Seamlessly Curate Words</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Defining and saving words in (and outside of) the app is quick, simple, and easy to discover.</li>
        </ul>
        
    
    <li> Effortlessly Learn Words</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilize cognitive science of learning and memory principles to maximize learning.</li>
            <li>Interface requires minimal cognitive overhead to process information and navigate. Cognitive Effort is focused on the words.</li>
            <li>Users don’t have to remember to study these words. They don’t need formal study sessions. Learning occurs in seamless and emergent intervals.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
</ol>

            <h2>Product</h2>
            <h4>Let's start with the big stuff. Design Goal Implementation?</h4>
                <br />
            <h5>Goal 1: Effortlessly Learn Words</h5>
                <h6></h6>
                <h6>Context Keyboard</h6>We can learn without studying through <strong>context</strong>.
                The Context Keyboard leverages contextual learning. It analyzes the context of what you type and suggests a word that makes sense from your Exquisite list in the QuickType bar. Using a word in context is an effective way to learn it!
                <br /><br>
<img src="http://placehold.it/650x250" alt="..." class="img-fluid">
                <br /><br>
                Type as normal, when the keyboard recognizes a context in which one of your vocabulary words fits, it will suggest it to you in green with a subtle audible “pop”. Tap the word to see the definition and ensure the word makes sense in the context and for a brief ‘study moment’. If it does, tap it again to insert the word. Else, tap above the keyboard to dismiss.
                <br /><br>
<img src="http://placehold.it/650x250" alt="..." class="img-fluid">
                <br /><br>
                I found that most users use the standard iOS keyboard. Hence, the Context Keyboard is designed to look and feel like the standard Apple iOS keyboard, but with the functionality of contextual vocabulary learning augmenting the standard QuickType bar. Users lack patience with different keyboards. Therefore, it must work flawlessly. No slowdowns, no crashes, else the user will abandon it.
            <br /><br>

                But It’s unlikely that a user will learn all of their vocabulary words with the Context Keyboard. Exquisite tracks usage metrics for each word and feeds them through an algorithm to emphasize unused and unknown words in Microquiz Notifications. 
                <br /><br>
                
                
                
        <h5>Microquiz Notifications </h5>
                Push notifications can be annoying. (User Insight) That's why only %% of users allow them.(LINK) This is a design challenge to overcome. Exquisite's notifications are unique/different/refreshing/actuallyuseful!
                <br /><br>
                 <h6> Exquisite's notifications are micro quizzes that you do on your time.</h6>
                <br />
                No need to open the app. Microquizzes are completed in the notification center. But they don't interrupt you. No sound, no vibration. Microquiz notifications are integral to the app, and are thoughtfully designed as such. They are <strong>powerful.</strong>
                <br /><br>
                
                 Retrieval practice with immediate feedback is one of the most effective ways to learn vocabulary (LINK). Exquisite's micro quizzes leverage do exactly this. Each type of micro quiz trains different aspects of vocabulary memory so that you can both recognize and recall your vocabulary words.
            
                rewrite//The first principle is retrieval. Active retrieval(NAME?) is a powerful way to learn(link) when paired with immediate feedback. The second principle is spaced repetition. We learn better through distributed study sessions than large chunks (link, perhpas quote?).

        <h4> The Cognitive Science of Exquisite</h4>
        Exquisite microquizzes strike a balance between training for recognition and recall. Both are important for users. Going into the cognitive science of it. FEEDBACK EMOJI SYSTEM!!!! !!SLANT: HOW COGNITITION IMPACTS THESE THINGS. 
        
        Each exquisite vocabulary word has a mastery rating. This is a metric of how well the user knows each word: Know, Kind of Know, Don't Know. These ratings can be changed by tapping the emoji. Mastery ratings, micro quiz scores, and context keyboard usage informs exquisite which words to focus on.
        
        LIST MASTERY
        
        <h4> Flashcards </h4>
        Flashcards are dedicated to formal study sessions. While they aren't strictly necessary. Student users desired an easy way to formally study for exam vocabulary.
        
        <h5>Lists Reworked</h5>
                Every list is different in terms of content and user goals. That’s why exquisite lists have settings! They're located in the new list dashboard.
                <br /><br>
                Proper list settings are critical to Exquisite's effectiveness. But I found that users didn't grasp which settings would yield desired results. As a result, you'll notice the "Learn List By:" setting. If the user is taking the GRE on June 1st, simply enter that date and exquisite will tailor a study plan of notifications towards meeting that goal! If no specific date is given, list settings can be dissociated. <h6>List settings control Notifications and basic study reminders. Every word shows up in the context keyboard.</h6>

                Navigating lists has changed too. Before, lists were toggled through search. That was clumsy and confusing. Now, tap the blue list title at the top. Select to view the list or study its flashcards. The list has a triangle dropdown indicator to signify the title's affordance of list changing.
                <br><br>
                for old+new: A lot more went into these design decisions, I'd be happy to discuss further... email here:.
        
        <h4> Visual Design</h4>
            <br>
                <img src="http://placehold.it/650x250" alt="..." class="img-fluid">

            <br />
                The goal for the visual design is to focus on the words. The user's cognitive effort is to be focused on the words, not the interace. That being said, the interface isn't bland like a dictionary page. Each word is on a virtual flashcard for visual relief and to hint at powerful functions. You'll see bits of color to highlight some relevant items and interactions. No function is hidden behind a swipe or gesture without a visual button or hint to accompany it because usability is prioritized. Swipes and gestures are only used as accelerators.
